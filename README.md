#  My First Flutter App – Personal Portfolio  

### *“Hello World, I am Mayank Pandey, and this is my Flutter flex!”* 



## About the App
This is my **first Flutter application**, a simple **personal portfolio app** where I share:  
- Who I am  
- How you can contact me  
- Where I hang out (*not literally, just locations 😎*)  

If you’re looking for the next coding genius (or a Flutter enthusiast trying not to break things), you’ve come to the right place.

##  Features That I’m Proud Of  
✅ Minimal, clean, and dark-green design (*green = genius vibes?*)  
✅ Displays professional details like:  
   - **Name**: Mayank Pandey  
   - **Title**: Flutter Developer  
   - **Contact Info**: Email & Phone Number (*but no spam, please!*)  
✅ Portrait mode only because horizontal layouts are *overrated*.  
✅ My first step into mobile app development—so take it easy on me.

## Fun Fact While Building This
- I whispered "please work" to the code more times than I can count.  
- I now understand why developers love Flutter. It’s like magic, except you’re the magician (sometimes with broken wands).  
- Bugs? Oh, I had plenty. Fixed them, though. At least I hope.

## 👀 What’s Next?  
This app is just the start. Some ideas for the future:  
- Add animations to look extra cool.  
- Maybe a “Contact Me” button that actually works?  
- Build more advanced apps to show I’m growing!
